#### how to install

`git clone https://github.com/librz/shell-scripts.git && bash ./shell-scripts/init.sh`

It may ask for sudo access, do it at your own risk.

If you don't want clone the project & wish to run `init.sh` directly, you could do:

`bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librz/shell-scripts/main/init.sh)`

For users who cannot access github because of censorship, this project is also hosted under `https://realrz.com`, you can still setup system by running:

`bash <(curl -sL https://realrz.com/shell-scripts/init.sh)`
